**Learning:** `Get-ChildItem -Filter` breaks when `LiteralPath` contains square brackets `[]` (like `[toolkit]`). However, falling back to pipeline filtering using `Where-Object` is extremely slow.
**Action:** Use `[System.Management.Automation.WildcardPattern]::Escape($path)` to escape the brackets, then use `-Path` and `-Filter` for drastically faster native filtering.
